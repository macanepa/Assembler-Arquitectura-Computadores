Implement function to format
the lines of code so it's easier
to execute the import program method

Count # of lines of DATA
Count # of lines of CODE

The DATA is saved in .mem file
    DIR_VALUE
    Example:
        00000001_00000011 //DIR = 1 val = 3
        00000002_00000101 // DIR = 2 val = 5


Add CALL, RET, PUSH, POP
to Assembler



Check which lines need to be counted in Code
